# This file contains configuration for the Flake Verification Bot, which will
# regularly try to reproduce flakes listed here and notify sheriffs when any of
# them stops being flaky. This is a Python literal file that should contain a
# list of dicts which lists properties passed to the flako recipe. Comments and
# trailing commas are allowed.
#
# The dictionaries are most-easily generated by running the v8_flako bot using
# the command generated on the watefall. After calibration, the bot will create
# a step called 'flakes.pyl entry' with a 'config' log that contains
# automatically generated entry for this file. Please do not forget to replace
# <bug-url> placeholder in the bug field with an actual bug URL tracking this
# flaky test.
#
# Please keep list sorted by bug numbers. Latest first.
